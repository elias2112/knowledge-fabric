# Knowledge Fabric - Qlik App

This Qlik app integrates with multiple REST indexes to fetch, normalize, and store documents and metadata. It supports on-demand searches across single or multiple sources, builds searchable indexes, and manages results in structured tables for exploration, analysis, and downstream reporting.

Unified knowledge search across Qlik content sources, built entirely in Qlik Sense using REST connectors.

- **Live search** against the Knowledge Fabric backend (`/search`).
- **On-demand indexing** for multiple sources (`/documents`).
- **Local preview tables** to explore results and debug.
- **Minimal coupling**: backend URLs configurable via variables; per-index connections decoupled.
